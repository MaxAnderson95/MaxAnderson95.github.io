## Introduction

As a DevOps Engineer, Iâ€™m tasked with ensuring secure and efficient communication between our various cloud and SaaS services. One of the most persistent challenges I encounter is managing long-lived secrets like API keys and service account credentials. These secrets are often left unrotated, creating security vulnerabilities and operational burdens.

I've recently been exploring Workload Identity Federation (WIF) as a solution to this problem. WIF allows workloads to authenticate with cloud services using short-lived tokens, eliminating the need for long-lived secrets. In this post, I'll cover how WIF works, its benefits, and how it can help organizations improve their security posture while reducing operational overhead.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into how I've used WIF at work to eliminate long-lived secrets and improve our security practices.

## The Problem with Long-Lived Secrets

Long-lived secrets, such as API keys and service account credentials, have been the backbone of service-to-service authentication for years. However, they come with significant drawbacks:

- **Security Risks**: Long-lived secrets can be leaked through various means, such as code repositories, misconfigured permissions, or accidental log output. Once compromised, these secrets can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to services.

- **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotating long-lived secrets is crucial for maintaining security, but it can be a cumbersome process. If not done correctly, it can lead to expired credentials, causing service disruptions and outages. Many organizations struggle with this, leading to a reliance on extremely long-lived secrets that are never rotated.

- **Operational Overhead**: Managing long-lived secrets requires additional operational overhead, including tracking when secrets were last rotated, ensuring all services are updated with new credentials, and monitoring for potential leaks.

## Workload Identity Federation: A Modern Solution

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) offers a modern solution to the problems associated with long-lived secrets. By leveraging the OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard, WIF allows workloads to authenticate with cloud services without the need for static credentials. Here's a high-level overview of how it works:

- **Establishing Trust**: A human administrator performs a one-time setup to establish trust between the two systems that need to communicate. This is done by configuring the Identity Provider (IDP) and the Relying Party (RP) to recognize each other. The IDP is responsible for issuing identity tokens, while the RP is the service that the workload wants to access.

- **IDP issues an ID Token**: When a workload needs to authenticate to the RP, it requests an ID token from *its own* IDP. This token contains information about the workload and is signed by the IDP's private key. The important point here is that workload can obtain this token simply by existing in the environment. This initial call does not require any explicit authentication or credentials to retrieve the token. Example: using Azure's Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) from within an Azure VM, or using the `ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` environment variable in GitHub Actions.

- **ID Token Exchange**: The workload then exchanges this ID token
